WindyCityDB iPhone App
==

WindyCityDB deserves its own iPhone app. So let’s make one!

Vision & Direction
==

We don’t have much time. The driving idea behind this app:

* Think big. Brainstorm about everything we’d like the app to do.
* Start small. Now, let’s get realistic. What can we deliver in a short amount of time?
* Deliver early. Have the app in the app store prior to WindyCityDB.

Dev Team
==

Team members & roles are as follows:

* Stan Fisher, developer in C and C++. Stan’s role will be to leverage his Obj-C skills to make the UI designs come to life. Stan will write most of the code for the app.
* Mike Rubin, developer of a highly addictive iPhone game called Togglem. Mike’s role will be to help us navigate through Obj-C and the app store.
* Kevin Zolkiewicz, designer of the WindyCityDB & WindyCityRails sites. Kevin’s role will be to drive the overall user experience of the app.
* Jeff Cohen, instructor at WindyCityRails and author of _Rails for .Net Developers_. Jeff teaches Ruby and he's learning Obj-C. Jeff knows OO principles and he will write code where needed.
* Ray Hightower, organizer. Ray’s role is to find talent and to pay for resources.
